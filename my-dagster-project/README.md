# Using Python with dbt project Example

This example demonstrates using Python alongside a medium-sized dbt project.

## Getting started

Bootstrap your own Dagster project with this example:

```bash
dagster project from-example --name my-dagster-project --example assets_dbt_python
```

To install this example and its Python dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Once you've done this, you can run:

```
dagit
```

to view this example in Dagster's UI, Dagit.
